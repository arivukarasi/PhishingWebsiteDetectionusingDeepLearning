THIS PROJECT IS ABOUT THE DETECTION OF PHISHING WEBSITES USING DEEP LEARNING

- It can be solved pretty easily 
- It can be solved by using deep neural networks
- We have to build a binary classifier 
- 30 features have to be extracted from the inputs which are websites

MODEL-1:

- We have used a model with 2 hidden layers above 100 units
- We have used Adam optimizer in this model

MODEL-2:

- We have used a model with 2 hidden layers above 100 units
- We have used RMSProp optimizer in this model

MODEL-3:

- We have used a model with 2 hidden layers above 100 units
- We have used SGD(Stochastic Gradient Descent) optimizer in this model

- We can also use dropout to overcome overfitting in case if we use more hidden units
